# MonitorDesktop

This is a very simple experimental project that send screenshots from the client, to the server periodically.

The project is extremely modular, every working part is separated into a different lightweight project.

MonitorDesktop targets .NET Core 3.0 (and .NET Standard 2.1 in its libraries), and uses the latest C# language features.

As of right now, MonitorDesktop has Websockets communication implementation built-in.
